My idea is to create a platform based completely based on Blockchain Technology that can solve the following four major issues related to the digitalization of Education : 

Attendance and Assignment Management: Creating a system where the attendance of the student and teacher is recorded based on a condition. This condition can be time-dependent. The assignments can be submitted on the block by the students through a personal account. 

Identity Concern: While signing up for any application there is a need to fill up some of your crucial personal details. With a system on blockchain technology, we can allow for lockers that carry your digital identity and can be used for signing in for various applications without sharing your personal details.

Certificate Management and Verification: Schools and students can manage their certificates and important documents on the block and can have full access over it’s display to any person or organization. Moreover, Academic credentials must be universally recognized and verifiable. Specific skill assertions can be verified and communicated with a digital badge. 

Libraries: Since Blockchain networks are managed by the people who are part of the network, books that are actually important and relevant to a particular network can be added so that library systems become more meaningful.   


For the solution of the said problem, I will be adopting Blockchain Technology because at present nothing can be better than this Blockchain Technology when it comes to security and privacy. 
Methodologies for implementing various solutions discussed are as follows : 

Attendance and Assignment Management: For managing attendance smart contracts can be coded which automatically updates the attendance of both student as well as teacher based on a time condition which for instance can be, attendance is recorded when a student has attended 30 minutes of class. Each student submits his/her work to the learning platform through his/her unique account, the smart contract running on it will review the student’s performance, and the results will be recorded into blocks. 

Identity Concern: The identity can be issued by the institution to students, who are the claim holder. This is a digital representation of their identity. The school/college uses keys linked to their decentralized identifier on the blockchain to sign the claim so that it is tamper-evident and anyone who gets it can validate that it was issued by an authorized organization. Students have a wallet to hold their claims and can use keys linked to a decentralized identifier that students control the blockchain to countersign the digital identity. When some application or platform needs to see that the student belongs to the organization, you can present the digital identity and the platform/application can verify that it hasn’t been changed, that the school/college issued it to the student, and the student is the one presenting it. Everyone can use the blockchain to lookup decentralized identifiers and retrieve any associated public keys. 

Certificate Management and Verification:  DLT solutions could streamline verification procedures and reduce fraudulent claims of unearned educational credits. Also, students can upload claims with a link to verification, and teachers can verify that claim. 

Libraries: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) could help libraries expand their services by building an enhanced metadata archive, developing a protocol for supporting community-based collections, and facilitating more effective management of digital rights.
